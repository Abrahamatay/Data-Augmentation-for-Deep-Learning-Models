📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on data augmentation techniques to improve the performance and generalization of deep learning models in image classification tasks. Augmentation methods were implemented and tested within CNN-based training pipelines to reduce overfitting and increase model robustness.

The project was developed and tested in a Google Colab environment for ease of reproducibility.

🚀 Features

Implementation of common augmentation techniques: rotation, flipping, scaling, brightness, and noise injection.

Integration of advanced augmentation methods such as MixUp and CutMix.

Comparison of CNN performance with vs. without augmentation.

Visualization of augmented datasets and training curves.

Reproducible experiments with Jupyter notebooks.
