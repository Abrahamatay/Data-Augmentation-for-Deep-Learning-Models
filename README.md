  Project Overview

This project implements various data augmentation techniques to increase dataset diversity and improve the robustness of machine learning workflows. The aim is to generate transformed versions of original images using different operations such as geometric transformations and noise injection.

The project was developed and tested in a Google Colab environment.

  Features

Standard augmentations: rotation, flipping, scaling, translation, cropping.

Color-based modifications: brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation changes.

Noise injection: Gaussian noise and blur operations.

Advanced augmentation techniques: MixUp and CutMix.

Visualization of augmented samples for comparison with original data.

Modular functions for easy integration into other machine learning pipelines.

  Tech Stack

Languages & Libraries: Python, NumPy, Pandas

Computer Vision Tools: OpenCV, Albumentations

Environment: Google Colab
